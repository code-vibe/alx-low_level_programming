# Alx-Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at Alx School. In these projects, which  occurred
throughout the duration of the Year 2022 September cohort9 curriculum, I am learning about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. The specific list of projects I have completed so far follows:


* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - debugging](./0x03-debugging)
